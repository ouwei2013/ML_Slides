1  Booked after seeing the great reviews on tripadvisor
2   This is an intimate but neat hotel in the trendy Montparnasse area , surrounded by a wide selection of bars and restaurants
3   It should be proud of the friendly , helpful staff where nothing seemed to be too much trouble 
4   The rooms were both distinctive and well presented if a little small
5   I doubt that there is anything better on offer for the price in what is a fabulous but very expensive city
6   Well done Le Fabe !!
7  I have nothing negative to say about this hotel! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as far as tourism,transportation etc
8   Additionally the staff presented a warm welcoming attitude by showing sincere concern with your level of comfort
9   Next aspect, i was impressed with was the setting of this hotel
10   It was very modern and each room offered it's own distinct character
11   the art work was simple but very decorative
12   The rooms were small but sufficient, and the cover was soft, thick and clean
13   In addition with the above, the hotel was in a great location
14   it was very close walking distance to public transportation(Metro)
15   Also there were plenty restaurants near if one did not fell like traveling far
16   The room also has refrigerators which is extremely convenient since there is a store across the street from this great hotel
17   I would highly recommend this hotel!
18  So it was my first time visiting Paris and thus I don’t know what I’m really comparing this little hotel to! How and ever, I booked Le Fabe on Tripadvisor reviews alone and it’s fair to say I wasn’t disappointed
19   The staff are really courteous, the rooms and décor are really boutiquey and funky
20   The beds and pillows were REALLY COSY! Which is strange for hotels! The “petit dejeuner” was plain and simple, probably a little bit pricey but nice all the same
21   Free Wifi was handy to stay in touch with the relatives
22   Finally the location is fine… a 5 minute walk away from Pernety Metro
23   … Nice to stroll to and fro and take in the sights and sounds of this peaceful Parisian neighbourhood
24  
25  The Le Fabe exceeded even our high expectations
26   The room and the service were excellent
27   The staff were always helpful and friendly
28   We will return
29  
30  If you want somewhere comfortable, within easy commute of central Paris (15 mins via the Metro to St Germain with local Metro station just 3 minutes walk away) and you want to avoid the usual tourist haunts and feel a bit more 'involved' in real Parisian life then you can't do much better than Le Fabe! With reasonable sized, well kept rooms, clean towels on tap, and if you're lucky enough to be in a ground floor room, a proper coffee machine thrown in, this place is hard to beat
31   There are some good eateries within walking distance too (particularly La Cantine du Troquet) as well as some nice Boulangeries to call into for breakfast
32   From our experience the staff were amazing, with nothing being too much trouble, even trying to help us book venues to eat in before we'd arrived and helping us with our 'pronunciation' and other challenges
33   All this, and great value for money
34   So if you don't mind being away from the usual tourist traps then this place comes highly recommended
35  
36  This hotel deserves it award for best service hotel
37   We had a great stay in one of the larger rooms
38   Good size rooms , really clean and very welcoming staff
39   Come out of pernaty metro turn right and its literally a three minute walk away on rue d l'ouest
40   We ate in a restaurant on the corner beside the hotel (they will recommend it if you ask the name!)
41   It was extremely tasty and had a great atmosphere "very french"
42   Only other recommendations if you're a first time visitor to paris is to book the eiffel tower online in advance (get to skip the queue) and take the highlights of the louvre tour if your not an art buff
43   Its an hour and a half long and just shows the masterpieces
44  
45  Having heard so much about unfriendly & rude people in France, it was a trip that we(my partner and I) made with a little apprehension
46   I really don't know about the other visitors, but for us,Paris was a fantastic experience
47   Right from the people helping us to get around Paris, they were more than willing to explain the route in their fluent french and somewhat broken english
48   We never felt unwelcome, rather it reminded me of India where people sometimes go out of their way to help
49   Coming back to the hotel review, the front desk is simply one of the best I have seen across all hotels I have ever visited
50   Alex(whom I did not meet in person, but was very helpful during online queries), Adrian and Sua(i hope i got his name right) were extremely helpful
51   Sua spent a good 20 mins explaining the entire route to get to the Eiffel and nearby attractions
52   His suggestion to check out the river cruise and the sparkling Eiffel at night meant that a good trip turned into a fantastic one(the hourly sparkling lights is a sight to behold, my girlfriend was dancing with delight :))
53   We thoroughly enjoyed the Metro travel, interacting with various people and visiting the sights
54   Sua also made sure that we got a nice room named the "French Romance" ;) Although the room isn't that big(compared to European hotels, it's big), it was well maintained with very comfy beds and a wonderful bathroom(with a Bathtub)
55   The lighting was sensuous and was quite pleasing :) There is a nice view to the street and the big windows are an added bonus
56   Breakfast in the morning is your regular fare, with a continental breakfast for 10 Euros
57   This includes coffee and other beverages
58   It was quite decent but you need to arrive early since items out of stock don't get replenished(we missed out on the chocolate bread)
59   The hotel is located in a very nice neighbourhood, with lots of eating options(Le Fabe doesn't have a regular restaurant-they serve only Breakfast)ranging from regular Bistros, to roadside cafes, a vegetarian restaurant(!!) and a few pizzerias
60   The commute to central Paris is 2 stops away,from Pernety to Montparnesse and a line change to Bir-Hakeim(the Eiffel station) and very convenient
61   You also have stores where you can pickup mobile food(sandwiches/wraps and juice) All in all, a highly recommended hotel for everyone, specially first time travellers
62  The Hotel was good value for money and I will surely stay again
63  
64  This small, tucked-away hotel lived up to its billing; it is clean, neatly decorated in a modern style that is continued into the breakfast area, where the bread is what you would expect of France (good!) and the coffee as good as you can get from a machine - something I did not expect to see in France and haven't (yet?) experienced in other coffeephile countries like Italy
65   The hotel staff are its chief asset, though, helpful without being obsequious and attentive to your wellbeing at all times
66   Exceptional! (Last point: it was lovely and warm and after we had nearly frozen to death in the Stade waiting for a rugby match that didn't happen, it was a great place to return to
67  )

69   Just make sure you head the right way out of the metro (if that's how you are arriving)
70   ALL the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly (sorry I forgot your names but thank you so much for making it a great stay)
71   I had mentioned I was going to be turning 21 when I was there and they even left a note wishing me in the room when I arrived
72   Rooms were named which was nice too
73   A good few little shops in the area between the hotel and metro if you need to pick up a few things or breakfast etc
74   Also have a computer that you can use to access internet if you don't have a laptop etc to use the wifi
75   The only negative was that the rooms were a bit small BUT it is Paris so I assume that's almost assumed
76  
77  We stayed at le Fabe for 3 nights at the beginning of February
78   Booked on the basis of Trip Advisor recommendation, reasonable prices and the modern look of the hotel
79   We were not disappointed
80   Really friendly staff, modern and clean
81   Good location - nice area, close to metro stop although we walked to more central areas like st germain on a couple of occasions
82   To summarise great hotel and would recommend
83
